                <p>
                   My name is Leo Lueddeann. I was born in Santa Monica, California. I have two siblings, a 15 year old brother and 16 year old sister. My family loves to travel overseas to experience new cultures and get a taste what life is like out side of the United States. I have a passion for Waterpolo and have been playing since I was 9.
                   I now play here at George Washington. We just finished our season in late November.

                   There are a few things in the world that I am passinaite about outside of academics and sports. I love to travel and experience new things. Convienietly, my parents also love to travel. When I was in sixth grade, my family took our first "big" trip. We went to Alaska and saw how much different it was then back home in California. My parents loved it and so did my siblings and I. After that trip, my Mom promised to me that she will take my family and I to every continent before I graduated highschool. We began by going to South America where we visited Chile, Peru, and Argentina. We then went to Europe where we went to 8 countries around the Baltic and later Montenegro, England, France, Italy. We then went to Asia where we visited Thailand and Hong Kong. Following that we went to Australia where we also stopped by New Zealand and Fiji. After that we went to Africa where we went to Kenya. Finally, we went to Antartica which was my favorite. We are now about to go to Costa Rica which I am excited for. In all of these different places we tried to avoid the touristy attractions and went for a more local approach such as learning their culture from locals and learning how to cook like the locals. Of course, when in the countries we went to the must see attractions while we were there but that wasn't the main focus.
