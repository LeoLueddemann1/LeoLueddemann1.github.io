                <p>
                   My name is Leo Lueddemann. I was born in Santa Monica, California. I have two siblings, a 15 year old brother and 16 year old sister. My family loves to travel overseas to experience new cultures and get a taste what life is like outside of the United States. I have a passion for water polo and have been playing since I was 9.
                   I now play here at George Washington. We just finished our season in late November.

                   There are a few things in the world that I am passionate about outside of academics and sports. I love to travel and experience new things. Conveniently, my parents also love to travel. When I was in sixth grade, my family took our first "big" trip. We went to Alaska and saw how much different it was then back home in California. My family and I loved it. After that trip, my mom promised me that she will take my family and me to every continent before I graduated high school. We began by going to South America where we visited Chile, Peru, and Argentina. We then went to Europe where we went to eight countries around the Baltic and later Montenegro, England, France, and Italy. We then went to Asia where we visited Thailand and Hong Kong. Following that, we went to Australia where we stopped by New Zealand and Fiji. Later, we went to Africa where we visited Kenya. Finally, we went to Antarctica which was my favorite. We are now about to go to Costa Rica which I am beyond excited about. In all of these different places, we tried to avoid the touristy attractions and decided to go for a more local approach such as learning their culture from the locals and learning how to cook like the locals. Of course, when in the countries we went to the must-see attractions while we were there but that wasn't the main focus.
